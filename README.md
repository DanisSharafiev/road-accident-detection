# Real-time Road Accident Detection
The project aims to develop a computer vision system capable of detecting road accidents in real-time video
streams. Using temporal recurrent networks and anomaly detection techniques, the system will analyze traffic
footage and identify abnormal events such as collisions or sudden stops.
# Our goal
The final goal is to build a prototype that can automatically monitor traffic cameras or dashcam footage and
issue alerts when an accident occurs. This reduces the reaction time of emergency services, minimizes human
supervision effort, and helps improve road safety.
# Importance
Road accidents cause many injuries and deaths worldwide. Fast detection and reporting can save lives by
bringing quicker medical help. Automated monitoring also helps traffic management and lowers costs from delays.
